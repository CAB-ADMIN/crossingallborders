We have a lot of Local and National projects to help those in need during difficulties in their lives. There are many different ways we help. We donate to other ministries that specialize in different situations such as drug addiction, homeless, unplanned pregnancies, domestic violence, disasters and nursing homes. We also donate to churches doing outreach in our community. We are involved a lot during the months of November and December when so many churches, individuals and groups are doing things to help others. Our most requested item during this time is hygiene kits. We also assist many churches and individuals doing shoeboxes for Samaritans Purse. 

==I would expand on this a bit more, since this is an important page I would recommend at least 300 words, but preferably 600+==
