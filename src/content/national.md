We have a variety of local and national projects to help those in need during difficulties in their lives.

We donate to other ministries that specialize in different situations such as drug addiction, homelessness, unplanned pregnancies, domestic violence, disasters and nursing homes.

We donate to churches doing outreach in our community. November and December are our busy months when so many churches, individuals and groups are doing things to help others. Our most requested item during this time is hygiene kits.

We also assist many churches and individuals doing shoeboxes for Samaritans Purse.
