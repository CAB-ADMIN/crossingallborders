This section provides a formal log of all development changes, from minor fixes to major releases. Each entry is versioned for clarity and accountability, serving as a reference point for the developer, the board, and any future contributors.

Entries are listed chronologically, with the oldest at the top and the newest at the bottom. The very top entry is a template and guide, including a checklist of tasks that should be completed whenever a push is made to production. Updates to version branches are not logged here until they are merged into production.

- Each production push should either be added as a patch/minor version increment (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 or 1.0.1 → 1.1.0) or, in the case of a significant release, as a new major version (e.g., 1.x.x → 2.0.0).

- Major versions should include a detailed document outlining the scope of work and changes delivered.

###### This ensures consistency, transparency, and a reliable record of the project’s evolution.
