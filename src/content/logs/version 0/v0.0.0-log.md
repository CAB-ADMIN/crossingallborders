### Summary
This entry documents how the website for Crossing ALL Borders Ministries is built, hosted, and maintained. It is a concise, non-technical reference for executive review.

### Purpose
- Present ministry information, news, events, and a donation flow.
- Keep the site fast, secure, low-maintenance, and easy to update.

### How the site runs (high level)
- Static site built with Eleventy (11ty). Content is written in Markdown and rendered via Nunjucks templates.
- Netlify handles automated builds and hosting. Pushing approved updates to the repository triggers a rebuild and deploy.
- Static assets (CSS, JS, images) are copied to the published site and served from Netlify’s CDN for performance and reliability.

### Hosting & domain
- Domain registrar: GoDaddy (the ministry owns and maintains the domain).
- Hosting / deployment: Netlify — account is managed under the ministry web email and controlled by the ministry.

### Contact & email flow
- Public contact inbox: info@crossingallborders.org — receives all incoming site inquiries.
- A separate ministry web email is used by the site to send outbound messages and to own hosting accounts. Staff reply to inquiries from info@crossingallborders.org via Gmail.

### Donations (VANCO)
- The ministry uses VANCO for donations. VANCO was configured by the board with developer assistance and is embedded into the site via an iframe so donors can give directly on the ministry website while using VANCO’s payment system.

### Approvals & content governance
- Minor changes (new photos, small text edits): approval required from the Executive Director.
- Major changes (new pages, design overhauls, major content changes): approval required from both the Executive Director and the Board of Directors.

### Maintenance & security
- Bi‑annual security and maintenance tasks (email encryption keys, IP blacklisting, anti-bot measures on contact forms, etc.) are scheduled and handled by Silas Schlax as lead maintainer.
- Secrets (API keys, email credentials) are stored in Netlify environment variables and are not committed to the repository.

### Legal & ownership
- Terms, privacy policy, and LICENSE are in place.
- LICENSE grants Silas Schlax ownership of the source code; Crossing ALL Borders Ministries retains ownership of site content and media (see LICENSE for details).

### How to make changes

All content change requests go to Silas Schlax (lead maintainer). Submit via a GitHub issue or pull request, or contact Silas directly. Include the page permalink, a short description of the change, and any assets (images/files) required.

1. Minor changes
   - Examples: small text edits, new or updated images, corrected links.
   - Process: send the request to Silas. Silas will implement and verify on staging or directly (as appropriate) and then deploy.
   - Approval: only Silas’ **review** is required.

2. Major changes
   - Examples: new pages, substantial content additions, design or layout changes affecting multiple pages.
   - Process:
     a. Silas implements the work in a feature branch and deploys to the staging site.  
     b. The Executive Director reviews the staging site and provides approval or feedback.  
     c. After ED approval, Silas merges to main for production deploy.
   - Approval: Executive Director approval required before production deploy.

3. Major Release (Phase / Version release)
   - Definition: large coordinated updates (site-wide redesign, version number change, new site phase, or other multi-area releases).
   - Process:
     a. Work is completed in feature branches and deployed to staging.  
     b. Executive Director and Board review the staging site.  
     c. A volunteer testing group verifies functionality and accessibility on staging.  
     d. Required fixes are addressed on staging, then the Board gives final sign-off.  
     e. Silas coordinates the production release and confirms post-release checks.
   - Approval: Executive Director + Board sign-off + volunteer testing sign-off.
