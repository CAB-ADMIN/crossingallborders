We receive medical donations from hospitals, clinics, doctor offices and individuals. We take **ANYTHING** medical. ***Open packages and expired items are all acceptable.*** Durable medical items are always needed. Hospital beds, walkers, bedside commodes, shower chairs, crutches, lift chairs, and electric scooters. These donations can be scheduled for pick-up when needed.

### How Do We Use Your Medical Donations:

1. We use the medical donations to send to clinics and hospitals internationally. 
2. We also donate to individuals in need in our community. These are given at no cost to help individuals and families in their time of need.
3. We send much needed medical supplies in during natural disasters nationally and internationally.

==Added extensive list of commonly needed items? Add list of never accepted items? (i.e. used syringes, needles, etc. CANT BE TO CAREFUL!)==

==I would expand on this a bit more, since this is an important page I would recommend at least 300 words, but preferably 600+==
