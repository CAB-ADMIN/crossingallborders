We in the United States are blessed with excellent medical care. This unfortunately is not the case in many other parts of the world. Medical donations became part of our ministry in 2019 when the Lord opened the door for us to take over medical donations from another non-profit ministry. We receive medical supply donations from a major local hospital every other week. These donations consist of a wide variety of items from basic first aid to surgical kits. We have been privileged to provide materials to hospitals and clinics in 12 countries thus far.

These medical supplies are only shipped to medical doctors and not to individuals. We distribute non-prescription medical goods to those in need in our local community.

We also donate items to churches, organizations, and Campbell University Medical School for their medical mission trips. We have distributed entire shipping containers of medical supplies to hospitals in Haiti, Ukraine, Zambia and St. Lucia. We shipped medical books and items needed in 2022 to help start a medical college in Congo. In 2025 we shipped items to Zambia to start a new medical clinic.

We accept medical donations from clinics, doctors, and individuals, including open packages and expired items.

Durable medical items are always needed. These include hospital beds, walkers, bedside commodes, shower chairs, crutches, lift chairs and electric scooters. These donations can be scheduled for pick-up as needed.
