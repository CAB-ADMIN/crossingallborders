#### Things that ***ALWAYS*** need to be done:

1. **Sort clothes** – We sort by season, and gender.

2. **Sorting and bagging shoes** – We bag each pair of shoes and mark the size for distribution for those in need.

3. **Make Hygiene kits** – This is a great area for families with young children to work. It is simple, easy for them to see they made a difference in just 30 minutes. They can understand how it makes a difference.

4. **Sorting & boxing medical supplies** – We receive medical donations on a regular basis. We sort these by categories and box them to send to locations of need.

5. **Packing shipments for local, national, and international needs** – We always have multiple projects going on at one time that need to be packed and prepared to ship.

6. **Pulling orders of requested items** – We receive request for supplies needed by churches and other ministries.

7. **Sorting donations that have come in and putting them in the correct area** – We receive donations for individual, other ministries and businesses.

8. **Cutting fabric for our sewing ministry** – We have a sewing ministry where individuals sew bags in their homes. We cut the fabric for this project.

9. **General maintenance** – taking trash out, cleaning bathrooms, sweeping floors.
