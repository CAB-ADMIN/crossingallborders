Selfless discipleship through Christian service is the engine that powers Crossing all Borders. Come be a part of what God is doing! Come when you can, leave when you need to.

Individual volunteers can serve during our [regular hours](/contact/#our-hours) and volunteer without an appointment. For groups of 10 or more, please call (910-890-7201) to schedule a time to come.


### Who Can Volunteer?

Everyone! We welcome all ages. We have jobs for those that need to sit. We work with families with special needs children to accommodate their abilities and create the environment that works for them. We welcome individuals and groups up to 50 people at one time. This included families, youth groups, ladies'; groups, men’s groups, scout troops, businesses, and school clubs. We work with those who need service hours for clubs and those who need required community service hours for the courts upon approval. If you are willing, God can use you!
