### Our Purpose: 

###### Our singular objective is to advance the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ in truth and in action. Salvation comes only through the Lord Jesus Christ.

> "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me" – John 14:6.


### Our Mission:

We strive to minister to the entire person, both physically and spiritually, in their time of need by following the example Jesus gave us in Matthew 14:13-21.  There HE gave us an example of providing for their physical need of hunger as well as their spiritual needs. 

We meet an individual’s tangible needs during life’s difficult times while offering love and compassion. In doing so, we build relationships and share the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

…If we feed and clothe people but do not share the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, Did we truly help them?

Individual needs can range from drug addiction, homelessness, illnesses, unplanned pregnancies, domestic violence, to natural disasters and wars. 



We meet these needs in local communities, across our nation, and in other countries through multiple ways. Those ways include donations to church outreach programs, and other Christian based ministries that align with our purpose.



###### We cross geographically, ethnic, economic, educational and denominational borders to meet the needs of ALL people. We strive to give the best as if we were giving it to Jesus himself.

>  "40 Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me" – Matthew 25:31-46.





### Our Beliefs:

###### 1. Scripture is our foundation. We are committed to serving others and living according to its truth and authority.{#non-list-style}

> "ALL scripture is given by the inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works" – 2 Timothy 3:16-17.

###### 2. Our Faith is without borders; we trust the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives to serve HIM in boldness, sharing the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ knowing it is not of ourselves but of HIM who lives in us.

> "If you have the faith of a mustard seed.....nothing will be impossible for you" – Matthew 17:20.

###### 3. We serve with joy, knowing God is faithful.

> "And let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not." – Galatians 6:9.

###### 4. We serve knowing the Lord will return one day for HIS people and we want to be serving HIM when HE returns.

> "Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are white already to harvest" – John 4:35.

### Our History:
***(new section in the works)***
Long before this ministry was called Crossing All Borders Ministry (named in 2018) it was referred to as The Mission Room. Since my parents and I came to know the Lord through missionaries from the US while my dad was stationed in Japan, we have had a heart for missions. So, in 1984, shortly after getting married I started shipping small packages to missionaries for my ladies Sunday school class at Faith Bible Fellowship.

We did ministry for fifteen years out of three Sunday school rooms with donations from individuals in the church, friends, and family. The ministry grew in a whole new way in 1999 when we received our first donation from a company. We received pallets of UPS damaged and overstock items from the Bob Barker Company in Fuquay-Varina. They are the leading supplier in the USA to prisons and detention centers. They also supply to hospitals, schools, and law enforcement. As their business has grown, so have our donations. We went from ten pallets every other month to as many as twenty-eight a month currently. One of the items we receive a lot of is damaged or discontinued prison uniforms. You will read about how we repurpose the fabric on our sewing page.

The 16,000 square foot warehouse space we are blessed to use was owned by Bob Barker until March 2020. He was so kind to bless us with using it rent free prior to selling.
