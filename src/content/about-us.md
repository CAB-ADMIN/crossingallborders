### Our History:
Long before this ministry was called Crossing All Borders Ministry (named in 2018) it was referred to as The Mission Room. Since my parents and I came to know the Lord through missionaries from the US while my dad was stationed in Japan, we have had a heart for missions. So, in 1984, shortly after getting married I started shipping small packages to missionaries for my ladies Sunday school class at Faith Bible Fellowship.

We did ministry for fifteen years out of three Sunday school rooms with donations from individuals in the church, friends, and family. The ministry grew in a whole new way in 1999 when we received our first donation from a company. We received pallets of UPS damaged and overstock items from the Bob Barker Company in Fuquay-Varina. They are the leading supplier in the USA to prisons and detention centers. They also supply to hospitals, schools, and law enforcement. As their business has grown, so have our donations. We went from ten pallets every other month to as many as twenty-eight a month currently. One of the items we receive a lot of is damaged or discontinued prison uniforms. You will read about how we repurpose the fabric on our sewing page.

The 16,000 square foot warehouse space we are blessed to use was owned by Bob Barker until March 2020. He was so kind to bless us with using it rent free prior to selling.
