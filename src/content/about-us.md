### Our Mission: 

We cross geographic, ethnic, educational and denominational borders to help those in need.

We strive to demonstrate the love of Jesus Christ through donations of tangible goods. Our mission is to participate in the work of the Holy Spirit to reach people for Christ and to provide opportunities for spiritual growth through service.


### Our Beliefs:

###### There is one God. He is the creator and ruler of the universe.

> “I am the LORD and there is no other; There is no God besides Me.” – Isaiah 45:5.

###### Jesus Christ is the son of God. He was crucified as a sacrifice for the sins of all people. He arose from the dead and ascended into heaven. He is the only path to salvation.

> “Jesus answered, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’” – John 14:6.

###### Scripture is our foundation. We are committed to serving others and living according to its truth and authority.

> “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.” – 2 Timothy 3:16-17.

###### God calls us to serve all that are in need.

> “And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.’” – Matthew 25:40.

###### Our Faith is without borders; we trust the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives to serve Him in boldness, sharing the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ knowing it is not of ourselves but of Him who lives in us.

> “So Jesus said to them, ‘Because of your unbelief; for assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.’” – Matthew 17:20.


###### We serve with joy, knowing God is faithful.

> “And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart.” – Galatians 6:9

###### We serve knowing the Lord will return one day for His people and we want to be serving Him when He returns.

> “Do you not say, ‘There are still four months and then comes the harvest’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest!” – John 4:35



### Our History:

Long before this ministry was called Crossing All Borders Ministry (named in 2018) it was referred to as The Mission Room. Since my parents and I came to know the Lord through missionaries from the US while my dad was stationed in Japan, we have had a heart for missions. So, in 1984, shortly after getting married I started shipping small packages to missionaries for my ladies Sunday school class at Faith Bible Fellowship.

We did ministry for fifteen years out of three Sunday school rooms with donations from individuals in the church, friends, and family. The ministry grew in a whole new way in 1999 when we received our first donation from a company. We received pallets of UPS damaged and overstock items from the Bob Barker Company in Fuquay-Varina. They are the leading supplier in the USA to prisons and detention centers. They also supply to hospitals, schools, and law enforcement. As their business has grown, so have our donations. We went from ten pallets every other month to as many as twenty-eight a month currently. One of the items we receive a lot of is damaged or discontinued prison uniforms. You will read about how we repurpose the fabric on our sewing page.

The 16,000 square foot warehouse space we are blessed to use was owned by Bob Barker until March 2020. He was so kind to bless us with using it rent free prior to selling. [Click here to read more about our story.](./our-story/)
