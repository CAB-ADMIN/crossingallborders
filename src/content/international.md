We are privileged to work with many churches in support of missionaries and ministries around the world. We provide tangible goods to groups who align with our beliefs. Some items we have shipped internationally are Bibles, hymn books, clothing, blankets, bedding, shoes, food, hygiene items, school supplies, desks, craft supplies, stuffed animals, and toys just to name a few.
