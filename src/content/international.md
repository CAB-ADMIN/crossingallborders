We are blessed to work with many churches to provide support to missionaries and ministries all around the world. We donate to other non-profits and churches based in the United States that have ministries in other countries. This is how our international connections have been made. Every ministry or church internationally that we have been blessed to support with tangible goods is a Christian church or ministry that lines up with our mission, purpose and our Biblical doctrine. If we cloth and feed those in need but do not share the Gospel of Jesus Christ as the only way to receive salvation and go to heaven upon death it is wood, hay and stubble. Clothes will wear out and be outgrown. Food will provide a meal but one will be hungry again. We want to give the bread of life and living water to those in need. We have been blessed to have something from our ministry go into 105 other countries through other non-profits, churches and individual going on mission trips and through shipping boxes and containers.

The items that we bless these ministries with allow them to do ministry to their people just as we do here in the United States. They use the items shipped to meet tangle needs just as we do in order to minister to the entire individual, physically, mentally and spiritually. We receive regular pictures, reports and updates on what they are doing and how to pray for them. We ship a huge variety of tangible items.  We ship Bibles, hymn books, clothing, blankets, bedding, shoes, food, hygiene items, school supplies, craft supplies, stuffed animals, toys just to name a few things.  The needs of people are the same all around the world. 

We ship a lot of school supplies and have sent textbooks and school desk in order to start more schools in five different countries. Education is something we take for granted but it is non existent or lacking basic supplies in many parts of the world.

We also ship medical supplies to hospitals and clinics in need. We currently have twelve countries that depend on us for basic and more complex supplies in order to provide medical care in their communities. We have shipped items to build medical clinics and even a medical college in Congo.

We have been blessed to also go see and serve in Dominican Republic, Honduras, and Guatemala.

***All ministries requesting assistance will be checked thoroughly before assistance is given. Any shipping cost is the responsibility of the recipient.***
