Can you sew? Can you cut fabric? Then we could use your skills in our sewing ministry. We have multiple sewing projects that can be done by individuals or groups. You make these items at home in your own time and return them to us. Most of these items are shipped internationally to orphanages.

### Types of projects you can help with:{.accent}


#### Bags out of prison uniforms

One of the donations we receive is new prison uniforms from the Bob Barker Company in Fuquay-Varina, NC. They are manufacturer defects, misprints and overstock that must be sent out of the United States. We ship all the wearable sizes to be used as clothing to those in need. The larger sizes (up to 20 XL) are cut into fabric squares from which basic cloth bags are made. As of August 2025, 57,000 bags have been made. They have gone into 105 countries through various organizations, churches and individuals. Our local Campbell University Medical School even uses them on their medical mission trips.

The uniform fabric has also been used to make Christmas stockings, adult bibs, hats, dresses, shorts, dolls, fidget quilts and bags for walkers.

#### Blankets

We receive extremely large sweatshirts/thermal shirts (4-10XL). These are made into blankets for the homeless and those in need during disasters. They are also used to make baby blankets for orphanages. 


#### Clothing

Teenagers in orphanages have difficulty obtaining clothes. Our volunteers make skirts and dresses to ship to these young ladies. We add a shirt from our clothing donations along with new underwear and ship them to orphanages in 12 countries.
