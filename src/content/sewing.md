We have many different sewing projects that can be done by individuals, church groups and school groups. These items are made and returned to us to ship to those in need internationally. Most items are shipped to orphanages to help children in need. If you can sew, we can use your skills to bless those in need.

### Types of projects you can help with:

#### 1. Bags out of prison uniforms

One of the donations we receive is new prison uniforms from the Bob Barker Company in Fuquay-Varina, NC. They are manufacture defects, misprints and overstock. They all must be sent out of the USA.

We cut the uniforms at the warehouse and individuals also cut these at home and return them to us. Then others pick them up and sew them in their homes.

History: We were getting so many uniforms that in 2012 my mother, Marlene Pannkuk, came up with the idea to make a simple cloth bag. As of August 2025, 57,000 bags have been made. They have gone into 105 countries through various organizations, churches, individuals and even our local Campbell University Medical School on their mission trips.

Other items that have been made from the uniforms: Quilts, Christmas stockings, beads of courage bags, adult bibs, hats, dresses, shorts, dolls, fidget quilts and bags for walkers.

#### 2. Blankets

We receive extremely large sweatshirts/thermal shirts (4-10XL). These are made into blankets for the homeless and those in need during disasters. We also make baby blankets for orphanages.

#### 3. Skirts:

It is difficult to find clothes for teenagers in orphanages. We have ladies that make skirts to ship to these young ladies. We add a shirt out of our clothing donations along with 2 new pairs of underwear and ship them to orphanages in 12 countries.
