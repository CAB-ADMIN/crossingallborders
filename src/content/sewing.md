We have many different sewing projects that can be done by individuals, church groups and school groups. These items are made and returned to us to ship to those in need internationally. Most items are shipped to orphanages to help children in need. If you can sew, we can use your skills to bless those in need.

#### 1. Making Bags out of Prison Uniforms:

We have many different sewing projects that can be done by individuals, church groups and school groups. These items are made and returned to us to ship to those in need internationally. Most items are shipped to orphanages to help children in need.

One of the donations we receive is new prison uniforms from the Bob Barker Company in Fuquay-Varina NC. They are manufacture defects, misprints and overstock. They all must be sent out of the USA. The small to 2xl can be used as medical scrubs and clothing. The 3 xl to 16 xl are not useable for clothing.
We were getting so much that in 2012 my mother, Marlene Pannkuk, came up with the idea to make a simple cloth bag. As of January 1, 2025, 57,0000 bags have been made. They have gone into 105 countries through Operation Mobilizations Logos Hope ministry ship, churches, individuals and Campbell University Medical School on mission trips.

We cut the uniforms at the warehouse and individuals also cut these at home and return them to us. Then others pick them up and sew them in their homes. We also ship the uniforms with sewing machines to orphanages and ministries that can use them to make school uniforms and clothing for the children. Other items that have been made are: Quilts, Christmas stockings, beads of courage bags, adult bibs, hats, dresses, shorts, dolls, fidget quilts and bags for walkers. ==needs some wording updates==

#### 2. Making Blankets:

We receive extremely large—4 to 10XL—sweatshirts and thermal shirts that are too large for anyone to wear. These are made into blankets for the homeless and those in need during disasters. We also make baby blankets for orphanages. ==needs more details==

#### 3. Making Skirts:

It is difficult to find clothes for teenagers in orphanages. We have ladies that make skirts to ship to these young ladies. We add a shirt out of our clothing donations along with 2 new pairs of underwear and ship them to orphanages in 12 countries. ==needs some wording updates and maybe more details==

#### 4. Making Pillowcase & T-Shirt Dresses:

These are made for girls in orphanages and shipped to 12 different countries. ==needs some more details==

We receive baby bundle quilts and pillowcase dresses sewn by the ladies of the Catholic church in St. Cloud Minnesota. The baby bundle quilts have 3 receiving blankets, 3 onesies, 3 burp rags, 3 cloth diapers, a pack of diaper pins and a bar of dove soap wrapped in a quilt. We ship these to the women’s birthing centers internationally. ==not sure how this fits in, its kinds isolated, maybe incoperate into a section or in one of the above things?==
