### Tangible Donations

###### Crossing All Borders Ministries accepts a wide variety of tangible donations; however, some items are not acceptable. When considering donating, ask yourself, “Would I give this to Jesus?”, “Would I like to receive this if I was in need?”. If the answer is yes, then please donate it to be a blessing to someone else.

> “Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” – Matthew 25:40
