### Financial Donations

==detail here, add details such as checks, vanco, and if needed Venmo for the crazy people??==

<a href="#"><button class="giving" id="middle">Give Now!</button></a>


### Tangible Donations

==Something about how CAB accepts more things, but use your best judgment, ask yourself "would I like to receive this?" If the answer is no, then we probably do not either, consider some alternative methods of getting rid of it! That said here is a general list of accepted items, and a list of items we cannot and or will not accept. Note that these lists are not extensive, that meaning not all items are listed, and that we may accept or not accept items not listed here. If you have questions about a specific item, please contact us via the [contact page](/contact) or call Joeth Strickland at [910-890-7201](tel:910-890-7201).==

==Add something about when you can donate physical items (do not list hours again), but also let them know to not just leave them outside the door...==
