### Tangible Donations

###### Crossing All Borders Ministries accepts a wide variety of tangible donations, but unfortunately we cannot accept everything. donating think to yourself, “Would I give this to Jesus?”, “Would I like to receive this if I was in need?”. If the answer is YES, then please donate it to be a blessing to someone else. If NO, then does it need to go in the trash or be recycled instead? 

> “Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” – Matthew 25:40 (NIV)
